### Aim:- 
To predict population of a country using atmost 5 countries

### Method:- 
Used Lasso to get sparse weight matrix with at most 5 wieghts

### Results:-
Used Gephi to visualize those weights and was able to find intresting insights which are very obvious from the history.
For example population of U.S.A. is being affected by nations like Mexico, Honduras and also some african nations.
